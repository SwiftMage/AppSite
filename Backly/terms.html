            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Backly application and services operated by AppSpire ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
            
            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
            
            <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h3>Use of the Service</h3>
            <p>Backly provides tools for creating and customizing background images. You may use these tools for personal or commercial purposes subject to these Terms.</p>

            <h3>AI-Generated Background Images</h3>
            <p>Please be aware that any AI background images that you generate through our service will be stored on our servers and may be included in future versions of the product. This helps us improve our service and provide better background options for all users.</p>
            <p>However, we do not store your personal images or any customizations you make to images. Only the images that are generated by OpenAI through our application are stored on our servers. Your privacy regarding personal content remains protected.</p>

            <h3>Content Ownership</h3>
            <p>When you generate backgrounds using our AI tools, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and distribute those AI-generated backgrounds in future versions of Backly.</p>
            <p>For any personal images you import or customizations you create, you retain all your rights to this content, and we claim no ownership rights over them.</p>

            <h3>Account Termination</h3>

            <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>In no event shall AppSpire, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</p>

            <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
